# Django-personal-website

This is a Django-based personal website I created for myself based on Vlad-moroshan's git repository
Live example is [here](https://fangyiyu.herokuapp.com/)

# Installation and Running

* Run the command `git clone <repository-url>` to have this repository locally in your computer
* Change into the new directory
* Change DUBUG to True when running on your local machine, to True when deploy
* Run the command `python manage.py runserver`
* Open your web browser and enter the adress of your local server (usually its http://127.0.0.1:8000 )
